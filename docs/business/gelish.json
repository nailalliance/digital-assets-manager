The IQ also has a new digital display with a no-look dial to easily dial RPMs up and down, and a pause button for quick stops during services. The Gelish® Go File™ iQ has 23% more torque with Smart Torque Technology™."}, {"question": "Does the IQ come with presets?", "answer": "Yes, the Gelish® Go File™ iQ comes with 3 programmable presets."}, {"question": "What is the benefit of having presets?", "answer": "Presets allow you to work within your most used RPM zones without having to constantly adjust the dial of the e-file. Touching the dial less means endless time saved per service which adds up to more clients and more money!"}, {"question": "Can I change the presets?", "answer": "Yes, the presets can be adjusted based on your power needs. Simply turn the dial to your selected speed, hold down the preset button, and go!"}, {"question": "Are the control box, power dock and handpiece acetone resistant?", "answer": "Yes, they are acetone resistant."}, {"question": "How do I maintain upkeep of my Gelish® Go File™ iQ?", "answer": "To maintain best working condition of your Gelish® Go File™ iQ, keep dust to a minimum. Do a quick dust off between services and a thorough wipe down at the end of the day to prevent dust build-up. While the unit is acetone resistant, avoid allowing acetone or other harsh chemicals to sit on the unit long-term or the finish could be affected."}, {"question": "Is the IQ a mobile or desktop unit?", "answer": "The Gelish® Go File™ iQ revolutionizes the hybrid e-file with its unique power dock that allows it to be used as both a desktop and mobile unit. Go anywhere with the lightweight controller and handpiece, or dock on your station with the space saving power dock. Used while charging, the iQ maintains ideal power levels while having the compact profile of a mobile unit, and can simultaneously charge your personal devices while in use."}, {"question": "Can I file while charging?", "answer": "Yes, the unit can simultaneously charge and be in use with no effect on power levels."}, {"question": "What do the battery light colors indicate?", "answer": "The battery light has 3 different colors that indicate the level of battery charge left. Blue is 100%-30% charged, Red is less than 30% charged, and Yellow flashing means the unit is charging."}, {"question": "Can I use this on other nail products?", "answer": "Yes, the Gelish® Go File™ iQ can be used with other nail products.

Our products meet global safety standards and requirements. Please follow all safety instructions for use. Certifications for the Gelish® Go File™ iQ include FCC, CE, UKCA, ROHS, NOM, ETL, WEEE."}, {"question": "What is Smart Torque Technology™?", "answer": "As file pressure increases, Smart Torque Technology™ kicks in, within 0.08 seconds, instructing the motor to simultaneously drive more power to the handpiece while maximizing torque. Smart Torque Technology™ gives 23% more torque than with the first generation Gelish® Go File™."}, {"question": "Why is torque more important than speed?", "answer": "While speed and RPMs are important, we feel that Torque is even more important when it comes to using your e-file. The Smart Torque Technology™ behind the Gelish® Go File™ iQ ensures that instead of just spinning fast, your unit will have enough power behind it to drill through any enhancements you put in its path."}, {"question": "How many speeds does the file have?", "answer": "The Gelish® Go File™ iQ has 25 speeds."}, {"question": "What is the RPM range of the Gelish® Go File™ iQ?", "answer": "The Gelish® Go File™ iQ works within 3 RPM zones ranging from 1,000 RPMs to 25,000 RPMs."}, {"question": "How do the warranties for the Gelish® Go File™ iQ work?", "answer": "The Gelish® Go File™ iQ warranty is split into two parts, a 1 year limited warranty that covers all manufacturer defects, and a 2 year warranty that covers defects specifically related to the motor, controller, PCB board, power dock, and battery."}, {"question": "How long do the warranties last?", "answer": "The Gelish® Go File™ warranty begins at the day of purchase, provided that the warranty is registered within the first 30 days. For the first full year, all manufacturer defects are covered. Then for 1 additional year after that the motor, controller, PCB board, power dock, and battery are covered."}, {"question": "How do I register my file for warranty?", "answer": "Scan the QR code on the bottom of the box to visit the website and register your Gelish® Go File™ iQ for warranty."}, {"question": "Can I return my Go File?", "answer": "For standard returns, please consult your authorized distributor.
